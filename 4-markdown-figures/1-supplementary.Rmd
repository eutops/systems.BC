No results remained significant after Benjamini-Hochberg correction. Note, significance thresholds for buccal, cervical and blood samples are different as Benjamini-Hochberg correction was applied, a method for controlling the false discovery rate using a ‘step-up’ method. Alternative approaches, such as correction generic thresholds such as p\textless10\textsuperscript{-5} have also been proposed and could alternatively be applied.

Annotated is the corresponding odds ratio [95\% confidence interval]. \textbf{c} Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in buccal (blue) and cervical (red) samples within the discovery sets. \textbf{d} Examples of DMRs overlapping between buccal (dashed lines) and cervical samples (solid lines). Mean methylation beta values in controls (blue) and BC cases (red) are visualized. \textit{NCK1/RP11-85F14.1} (p=0.00094 for buccal samples; p=0.015 for cervical samples) and \textit{CCDC88C} (p=0.0072 for buccal samples; p=0.012 for cervical samples) exhibit opposing differential methylation between cases and controls in buccal and cervical samples (i.e., hypermethylation in BC cases in cervical samples and hypomethylation in BC cases in buccal samples), whereas \textit{RP11-551L14.1} (p=0.011 for buccal samples; 0.0002 for cervical samples) and \textit{LTBP4} (p=0.002 for buccal samples. p=0.0045 for cervical samples) show the same directionality of differential methylation in the two samples.

The odds ratios and confidence intervals in a and b were computed leveraging a contingency table of CpGs (in both cervical and buccal DMPs, in cervical or buccal DMPs only, not a DMP in either tissue) within each quadrant.  Correlation coefficients in a and b are Pearson correlation coefficients.
